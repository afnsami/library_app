<p>This time I had to make a library app from scratch</p>
<p>The part where it felt the most difficult  is when I had to render each book object when user presses AddBook button.

Also when to delete the book div when user clicks delete button in the bookCard.</p>

<p>It took me around<b>2 months</b>. It is longer than usual. Mainly because I was busy with other things in life.</p>

<p>I am glad I finished it. I have to learn more and with more seriousness.</p>
